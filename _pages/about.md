I am a joint-trained master's candidate and engineer at Tongji University, the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Additionally, I hold student memberships with the Chinese Association of Automation, the China Energy Research Society, and the Shanghai Traffic Engineering Society. My academic journey commenced at China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, and Peking University, focusing on safety engineering within semi-open scenarios such as transportation roads and mining areas, as well as large engineering systems like bridges and enclosed spaces of power plant boilers, with an emphasis on risk assessment and accident prevention.

My current role at the SPIC involves the application of multi-agent systems, including inspection drones and wall-climbing robots, for the inspection and risk evaluation of large engineering systems. At Tongji University, my primary focus is on the development of intelligent driving safety systems and the analysis of driver-related safety factors.

My research outcomes have been published in core journals such as "Coal Science and Technology" and Geofluids, and I have been honored with several awards, including the National Scholarship. I look forward to applying my understanding and skills in engineering, modeling, and economics to promote the safety of engineering systems and environmental sustainability in my future work, while also considering the translation of these into economic value.
